### Portfolio of Levi Josu√© Medina Burguillos (Next.js & Tailwind CSS)

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio, built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. This project serves as a showcase of my Front-end expertise and my ability to integrate modern serverless patterns and external APIs.

The live application can be viewed here:
